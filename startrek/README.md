TREKINST is a s/36 procedure that unwraps itself into STREK RPG-II source, STREKFM
display format member, and STREK procedure to launch the app.

The Q* directories here are associated files for AS/400 System/36 Environment.
CRTSRCPF on the files, and then FTP the members into them in ASCII mode. you should
then be able to compile and run the game on the 400.

I'll add more instructions here soon. Really.
